# TopScroll — chrome extension

### Description
★ Click on the left border of any page for scroll to the top. Just pull the cursor to the left screen edge, click — and you're there!  
★ Click again — and you're back where stopped reading.  
★ Or right click for scroll to the bottom.  

There are already a number of extensions for Chrome, which can add the "scroll to the top" button in all possible places. With TopScroll you don't need to aim any buttons, moving a mouse cursor to the screen edge is much easier and faster.

This extension does not affect the appearance of web pages.
This extension is useless if browser window is not fullscreen.
This extension may not work on some sites with nonstandard layout implementation.

### How it works
Adds 1-pixel-width invisible div to the left border of the page with appropriate JS event handlers. Viola!

### Install
[Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/topscroll/hnninpkmflibadgihijdmlilikhdgajj)
