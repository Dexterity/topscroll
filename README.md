# TopScroll — Chrome extension

### Description
★ Click on the left border of any page for scroll to the top. Just pull the cursor to the left screen edge, click — and you're there!  
★ Click again — and you're back where stopped reading.  
★ Or right click for scroll to the bottom.  

There are already a number of Chrome extensions which can add the "scroll to the top" button in all possible places. With TopScroll you don't need to aim any buttons, moving a mouse cursor to the screen edge is much easier and faster.

If you use the browser not in fullscreen mode, you may want to increase clickable area width in extension options.  

This extension does not affect the appearance of web pages.  
This extension may not work on some sites with nonstandard layout implementation.

### How it works
Adds 1-pixel-width invisible `div` to the left border of the page with appropriate JS event handlers. Viola!
